# Text Mining with R's tm package

Text mining is the analysis of data contained in natural language text. The application of text mining techniques to solve business problems is called text analytics. Text mining extracts precise information based on much more than just keywords. Instead, you search for entities or concepts, relationships, phrases, sentences – even numerical information in context. 
The tm package is a framework for text mining applications within R. This amazing package was developed by Ingo Feinerer.
